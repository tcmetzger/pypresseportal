PyPresseportal
==============

A Python interface into the `presseportal.de <htps://www.presseportal.de>`_ API
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PyPresseportal is a Python wrapper for the API of the website `presseportal.de <htps://www.presseportal.de>`_.
With PyPresseportal, you can use Python objects to easily access the website's extensive data resources. 

The website `presseportal.de <htps://www.presseportal.de>`_ is a service provided by 'news aktuell', 
owned by dpa (Deutsche Presse Agentur). It is one of the biggest distributors of press releases and 
investor relations announcements in Germany. For example, almost all police and fire departments 
use this service to distribute their press releases.

PyPresseportal is in no way connected to `presseportal.de <htps://www.presseportal.de>`_, 
'news aktuell' or dpa. PyPresseportal is independently developed by volunteers as an Open Source 
library.

.. note:: A valid API key from presseportal.de is required to access data. You can find 
   information on the API's Terms of use and apply for an API key at `<https://api.presseportal.de/en>`_.
